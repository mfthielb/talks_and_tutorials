# Reproducing Simulation Results
Our understanding of probabilistic fairness and its expected behavior are based on simulations from hypothetical models with differening levels of unfairness. 

Since Jurity 2.0, simulation functions are included as part of the package, allowing future research and testing of different simulation scenarios. 

The following files in this repository can be used in conjunction with the simulation class in the Jurity library.
- simulation.py: Runs the code to create simulated model results with different levels of unfairness.
- simulation_compare_to_model.py: Compares probabilistic fairness estimates to using models that try to predict protected class membership.
